# netflix-content-analysis
Project Overview

This project involves cleaning and analyzing a Netflix titles dataset, which includes shows and movies released on the platform. The goal was to uncover meaningful insights such as the most common genres, the distribution of content over the years, and how various metrics like runtime, type, and production countries affect content on Netflix.
Tools Used

    Python (Pandas, NumPy)

    Jupyter Notebook

    (Optional: Matplotlib/Seaborn â€“ to be added)

 Key Tasks Performed

    Data Cleaning

        Handled missing values

        Removed redundant/irrelevant entries

        Converted data types (e.g., year, ratings)

        Created a content_age column to reflect how old the content is

    Feature Engineering

        Extracted new insights like:

            Content age (2025 - release_year)

            Aggregated genres and production countries

        Grouped and counted various fields like type, release years, and genres

    Insights & Analysis

        Most popular content type (movies vs. shows)

        Most common genres (e.g., comedy, drama)

        Years with highest releases

        Most frequent production countries

        Observed distribution of runtime and content aging

Sample Insights

    The most frequent type on Netflix is Movie

    The most common genre is Comedy

    2019 had the highest number of releases

    The most frequent production country is likely the United States

 Why This Matters

Netflix relies heavily on analytics to decide what content to recommend, renew, or acquire. This type of data analysis mimics real-world business intelligence work, where data-driven decisions improve user experience and engagement.
